Horiseon Website

This was a project assignment was to refactor the HTML and CSS for an existing webpage. I faced many challenges in this process but felt I was able to accomplish my goal, to leave the code cleaner than I found it.

I learned that sometimes, very small edits can have a major change on how the webpage looks. I was able to use the Chrome Developer Tool to see what some of my changes would do without disturbing the code.
